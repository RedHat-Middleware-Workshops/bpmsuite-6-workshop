= JBoss BPMSuite 6.x Workshop Labs

== Use Case

In the following lab-series we will define, model and execute a business-process for a travel agency. This travel-agency has recently decided that they want to automate 
their business process that deals with the booking of both flights and hotels, including the credit-card payment process. The business case for automating this process is to:

* streamline process execution
* make the process repeatable and predictable
* automate business rule execution
* provide a better user experience for the customers by providing faster feedback
* allow for process analysis to identify potential bottlenecks
* implement the first steps for process optimization.

These labs are based on the Red Hat JBoss BPMSuite Travel Agency demo, which can be found https://github.com/jbossdemocentral/bpms-travel-agency-demo[here].

The final business process is show below.

To recreate the full process from scratch would be too much work for this one-day workshop. Therefore, because we still want to touch the most important aspects of BPMSuite and we 
want to implement a full process, we will start with pre-defined parts of the process to which we will add the requirement elements to create the full implementation.
