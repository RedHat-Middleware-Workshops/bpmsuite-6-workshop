  # Disable the new default behavior introduced in Vagrant 1.7, to
  # ensure that all Vagrant machines will use the same SSH key pair.
  # See https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant/issues/5005
  config.ssh.insert_key = false

  # Disable automatic box update checking. If you disable this, then
  # boxes will only be checked for updates when the user runs
  # `vagrant box outdated`. This is not recommended.

  # Create a forwarded port mapping which allows access to a specific port
  # within the machine from a port on the host machine. In the example below,
  # accessing "localhost:8080" will access port 80 on the guest machine.
  # config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 80, host: 8080

  # Create a private network, which allows host-only access to the machine
  # using a specific IP.
  # config.vm.network "private_network", ip: "192.168.33.10"
  config.vm.network "private_network", ip: "192.168.33.16"

  # Create a public network, which generally matched to bridged network.
  # Bridged networks make the machine appear as another physical device on
  # your network.
  # config.vm.network "public_network"

  # Share an additional folder to the guest VM. The first argument is
  # the path on the host to the actual folder. The second argument is
  # the path on the guest to mount the folder. And the optional third
  # argument is a set of non-required options.

  # Provider-specific configuration so you can fine-tune various
  # backing providers for Vagrant. These expose provider-specific options.
  # Example for VirtualBox:
  #
  config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |vb|
     vb.name = "jboss-bpmsuite-workshop"
  #   # Display the VirtualBox GUI when booting the machine
     vb.gui = true
  #
  #   # Customize the amount of memory on the VM:
     vb.memory = "4096"
     vb.cpus = 2
 
 # Add IDE controller for DVD drive
 #vb.customize ["storagectl", :id, "--name", "IDE Controller", "--add", "ide"]
 
  # Can call any VBoxManager customization command
#     vb.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--cpuexecutioncap", "50"]

  end

  # View the documentation for the provider you are using for more
  # information on available options.

  # Define a Vagrant Push strategy for pushing to Atlas. Other push strategies
  # such as FTP and Heroku are also available. See the documentation at
  # https://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/push/atlas.html for more information.
